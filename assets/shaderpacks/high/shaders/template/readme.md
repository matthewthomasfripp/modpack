# Editing Property Templates
The block, item, and entity property files are generated with a template builder. To modify these templates, you will need [PoTater](https://github.com/Null-MC/PoTater) to regenerate the final property files. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Null-MC/PoTater/releases) binary for your system, and place it in this `~/template` folder. Then run `~/update.sh` as needed to generate the new property files.

# Editing Colored Lighting
There are two ways to edit colored lighting (explained below). Either method will require editing the block.properties mappings.

## The Simple/Easy Way
New block IDs can be easily added to existing block/light mappings.

## The Advanced Way
Completely new block/light mappings can also be added, but it will require working with some GLSL code.
